# Cary City Data Analysis for Smarter Decisions

## Overview
This project analyzes data from the Building Permits and Public Safety Departments in Cary, North Carolina. Using Tableau, we've visualized and gained insights into key performance indicators over a span of 2022-2024. Our goal is to improve city operations and optimize resource allocation, public safety, and permit processes.

### Key Findings:
- **Building Permits:**
  - High active permits & cancellations.
  - Seasonal trends in permit applications.
  - Dominance of "unclassified" contractors.
  - Faster approval times, but still room for improvement.

- **Public Safety:**
  - Traffic accident hotspots and trends.
  - Crime trends and hotspots.
  - Fire & EMS resource allocation and false alarms.
